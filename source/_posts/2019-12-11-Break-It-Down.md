Problem breakdown is one of the most fundamental engineering techniques. Almost all types of knowledge work can benefit from it.

This year I have made 60% more git commits than last year. It is the result of breaking problems down to smaller scopes.

Effectively, each commit represents a less scoped problem, and more often than not, a simpler one. So this results in some great benefits.

The first benefit is that each commit becomes easier to digest by its reviewers, and thus able to attract more valid and constructive suggestions.

The other benefit is that the problem-solving process becomes more manageable.

Suppose you need 2 hours of contiguous time to solve a large problem. During that process, unfortunately, you may get interrupted. And those interruptions will cost you a lot of time to manage the mental state to settle back in. However, if you break such a problem down to 5 smaller ones, then on average, each will need just about 30 minutes. 30 minutes of uninterrupted time is much easier to come by than 2 hours.

Even if you do get interrupted in that case, since each problem is about 1/5 complex of the original one, it would probably cost just 1/5 of the time to recover from the interruption. Simple math.

The last benefit is on where to draw the line.

In an ideal world, you can pursue after your inner perfectionism without consequences. But in reality, there is always a decision to be made on when to stop pushing further. Otherwise, it may only result in your time running out, or budget running dry, or blocking more of your teammates, or maddening more of your clients or stakeholders, and so on. You certainly do not want any of those.

So by breaking down larger problems down to smaller scopes, it often becomes easier to realize which ones can be deferred, or even dropped. At Basecamp, they call it "Scope Hammering".

Just like any technique, it comes with some tradeoffs. And for this one, it's the time overhead. The less experienced you are in the domain, the more significant that overhead can be. But given its massive benefits, it's well worth it.

So stop chewing through that complex problem, go ahead and break it down.
