It is crucial for any work involving team collaboration to get a sense of each othersâ€™ whereabouts as quickly and accurately as possible. Usually, we resort to frequent meetings to get updates from each other.

But meetings are not always the best way for this scenario:
* Meetings are synchronous, so everyone has to wait for the others to finish before they can continue.
* Especially when communicating verbally, it is difficult not to misinterpret each others' words.
* It is challenging to scale up the team size because that would amount to more meetings and more probable misinterpretation of the updates.
* It is challenging to work as a distributed team if the team scatters around the world.

Building on top of the experience to {% post_link Road-to-Automation-Release-Notes 'automate our product release process' %}, we can now automate the process to [get updates](https://github.com/EQWorks/updates) from each other from exactly where work happens and consume them asynchronously at our own pace.
